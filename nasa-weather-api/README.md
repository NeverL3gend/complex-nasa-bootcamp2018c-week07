# NASA Weather API Project
This will display the location of NASA and the weather of the location

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This was something that was pretty nerve wrecking since API is something new and something I've never worked  with but really proud of. This project is really basic where it just pulls information from the NASA server and displays the picture of the day. Using JavaScript in this small project was really straight forward once I read upon few articles and received pointers

## Lessons Learned:

Currently this is a work in progress where designing the webpage when the API is automatically loading and is not easy since if you keep refreshing the page the amount request will be alot and I would need to get a new API key. As of now this just diaplys the information of the NASA sites and as well

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
